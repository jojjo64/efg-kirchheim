== Motivation and Process Overview

The WiFi in EFG Kirchheim is set up based on Unifi gear with a CloudKey as the central management component.
The security setup requires that besides the WPA2 PSK (pre shared key) a MAC address filter should be set up
and maintained to further lock down WiFi access.

The automation flow to realize the management process for this inventory of MAC addresses is as follows:

* a frontend request process with approval (which is not part of this git project) triggers an MS Flow workflow
* the MS Flow workflow creates an O365 Planner task (the task must have a defined format) in a Planner board (bucket)
dedicated to the MAC address filter automation

That's the place where we start:

* all open Planner tasks from the MS Planner bucket are read
* for each task (*ADDMAC* or *DELMAC*) the MAC address contained in the task
gets either added or deleted to the Unifi Cloud Key MAC filter list
* finally the MS Planner task will be set to completed

== Technical Overview
=== EFG Automation Parts
The EFG Automation python script suite comprises of these parts:

image::EFGAutomation.overview.png[Overview]

* the `efg_automation.py` main program
** implements the main CLI for EFG Automation
** imports all required subcomponents

* the `efg_o365.py` module
** automates the access to MS Planner Tasks
** is based on and extends the pip installable `O365` module (refer to https://github.com/O365/python-o365[])

* the `efg_wifi_automation.py` module
** realizes functions to add or delete a MAC address to the MAC Filter of a Cloud Key WiFi name (WiFi SSID)
** is based on and extends the pip installable `pyunifi` module

=== O365 Planner Task format

The required MS Planner Task format is as follows:

Additional Notes:

* the red labels are the field names when retrieving the task data via REST API
* the only allowed MAC address format is as shown here in the example
* after the EFG Automation has completed a MAC address task it will set the task to completed (= set percentComplete to 100)

== O365 Setup

=== Application Registration in the Azure App Portal

In order to access the MS Planner Task APIs the `efg_o365.py` module has to be set up as an application in the Azure Administration Portal.

Follow the instructions titled "Authenticate on behalf of a user" at https://github.com/O365/python-o365#authentication-steps[]
and make sure you have applied the following settings:

* add the `offline_access` permission as recommended in the docs
* as well add the `Tasks.ReadWrite` permission (so the app is allowed to work with MS Planner Tasks)
* Hint: The `User.Read` permission is required anyway...

At the end of the app registration note down the following values


|===
|Field Title (en)|Field Title (de)|Value

|Application ID
|Anwendungs-ID (Client)
|

|Tenant ID
|Verzeichnis-ID (Mandant)
|

|Secret Client Key
|Geheimer Client-Schl√ºssel
|

=== First Time Use of this App - generating the access token

When using the app for the first time you will have to follow this authentication procedure:

. the app will print out an access confirmation URL that you have to copy&paste to a web browser (recommended: Firefox)
and will then sit on a prompt expecting the redirect URI (see below)
. upon executing this URL via a browser confirm the access for your app
. the browser will then be redirected to the *redirect URI* you specified upon app registration (usually https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient[])
. copy&paste the *full redirect URI* back to the prompt on which the app is waiting
. after this step the full app access is established and a token file `o365_token.txt` has been created
in the current working directory
