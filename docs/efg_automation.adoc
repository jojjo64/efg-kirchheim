== Motivation and Process Overview

The WiFi in EFG Kirchheim is set up based on Unifi gear with a CloudKey as the central management component.
The security setup requires that besides the WPA2 PSK (pre shared key) a MAC address filter should be set up
and maintained to further lock down WiFi access.

The automation flow to realize the management process for this inventory of MAC addresses is as follows:

* a frontend request process with approval (which is not part of this git project) triggers an MS Flow workflow
* the MS Flow workflow creates an O365 Planner task (the task must have a defined format) in a Planner plan
dedicated to the MAC address filter automation

That's the place where we start:

* all open Planner tasks from the MS Planner plan are read
* for each task (*ADDMAC* or *DELMAC*) the MAC address contained in the task
gets either added or deleted to the Unifi Cloud Key MAC filter list of the WiFi name (SSID) specified in the MS Planner task
* finally the MS Planner task will be set to completed

== Technical Overview
=== EFG Automation Parts
The EFG Automation python script suite comprises of these parts:

image::EFGAutomation.overview.png[Overview]

* the `efg_automation.py` main program
** implements the main CLI for EFG Automation
** imports all required subcomponents

* the `efg_o365.py` module
** automates the access to MS Planner Tasks
** is based on and extends the pip installable `O365` module (refer to https://github.com/O365/python-o365[])

* the `efg_wifi_automation.py` module
** realizes functions to add or delete a MAC address to the MAC Filter of a Cloud Key WiFi name (WiFi SSID)
** is based on and extends the pip installable `pyunifi` module

=== O365 Planner Task format

The required MS Planner Task format is as follows:

image::EFGAutomation.MSPlannerTaskFormat.png[MS Planner Task Format]

Additional Notes:

* the red labels are the field names when retrieving the task data via REST API
* the only allowed MAC address format is as shown here in the example
* after the EFG Automation has completed a MAC address task it will set the task to completed (= set percentComplete to 100)

== O365 Setup

=== Application Registration in the Azure App Portal

In order to access the MS Planner Task APIs the `efg_o365.py` module has to be set up as an application in the Azure Administration Portal.

Follow the instructions titled "Authenticate on behalf of a user" at https://github.com/O365/python-o365#authentication-steps[]
and make sure you have applied the following settings:

* add the `offline_access` permission as recommended in the docs
* as well add the `Tasks.ReadWrite` permission (so the app is allowed to work with MS Planner Tasks)
* Hint: The `User.Read` permission is required anyway...

:icons: font
NOTE: Without the `offline_access` permission the access token would only be valid for 1 hour however
with this permission the maximum access token lifetime is 90 days, and any access using the token
within these 90 days renews the token for another 90 days.

At the end of the app registration note down the following values


|===
|Field Title (en)|Field Title (de)|Value

|Application ID
|Anwendungs-ID (Client)
|

|Tenant ID
|Verzeichnis-ID (Mandant)
|

|Secret Client Key
|Geheimer Client-Schl√ºssel
|

=== How to obtain the plan id for WiFi MAC Automation Tasks
As shown in <<_the_configuration_file_efg_automation_ini>> we will need the *planId* parameter to allow `efg_o365.py` to
filter out WiFi MAC tasks. To obtain that id follow these steps:

. create a dedicated MS Planner Plan for all WiFi Automation Tasks (in our case the name is `WiFi-Automation`)
. create a task in that Plan
. change to the `List` view
. to the right of the task do a RMB (right mouse button) click on the `...` Menu
. in the context menu showing up now click on `copy link for task`
. copy the link that shows up now in an editor of your choice
. see the picture below where the plan id is located in the link and copy that over into
the configuration file

image::EFGAutomation.FindPlanID.png[How to find the plan id]


=== First Time Use of this App - generating the access token

When using the app for the first time (after you have installed the application as shown in <<_installing_the_efg_automation_suite>>) you will have to follow this authentication procedure:

. run the `efg_o365.py` module from the command line with the `` parameter, e.g.

   python efg_o365.py --config <yourconfig.ini> --do_initial_auth show_open_tasks

. the app will print out an access confirmation URL that you have to copy&paste to a web browser (recommended: Firefox)
and will then sit on a prompt expecting the redirect URI (see below)
. upon executing this URL via a browser confirm the access for your app
. the browser will then be redirected to the *redirect URI* you specified upon app registration (usually https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient/<something>[])
. this URL does not lead to a valid existing site so the request will *fail* -- however:
. copy&paste the *full redirect URI* starting with `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient...` back to the prompt on which the app is waiting
. after this step the full app access is established and a token file `o365_token.txt` with the access token has
been created in the current working directory

:icons: font
CAUTION: The file `o365_token.txt` is equivalent to a password, thus protect this file from unwanted access.

== Installing the EFG Automation Suite
=== Installing the python programs from the github repository

:icons: font
[NOTE]
====
The prerequisites for the following steps are:

* git must be installed (`yum install git` for Fedora/CentOS derivates or `apt-get install git` for debian derivates)
* python3 >= 3.6 must be installed
====

Follow these steps:

[source,bash]
----
# cd to the directory where you want to get the EFG automation installed

# create a python3 virtual environment in a directory called venv
python3 -m venv venv

# activate the new virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# clone the git repo from github
git clone https://github.com/jojjo64/efg-kirchheim.git

# cd to the now cloned directory
cd efg-kirchheim

# install all python module dependencies listed in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
----


=== The configuration file `efg_automation.ini`
To start configuring the EFG Automation copy the example configuration file to the default config file name `efg_automation.ini`:

----
cp -p efg_automation.example.ini efg_automation.ini
----

The `efg_automation.ini` has these sections:

|===
|Section|Meaning

|CloudKey
|Required settings to access the Unifi CloudKey

|O365_Planner
|Required settings to access the MS Planner Tasks

|MSTeams_Notifications
|Required settings for posting status and alert messages into a MS Teams Channel

|EFGAutomation
|General settings for the entire suite
|===

==== CloudKey Section
The CloudKey section contains these settings:

    [CloudKey]
    host = <ip>
    user = <user>
    password = <password>
    update_mac_file_on_add_remove = yes

* set the `host` var to the cloud key IP
* set user and password of a CloudKey user with administrative rights into the `user` and `password` vars

==== O365_Planner Section
The O365_Planner section contains these settings:

    [O365_Planner]
    tenant = <yourtenant>
    app_id = <app_id>
    app_token = <app_token>
    wifi_automation_plan_id = <plan_id>

* refer to the <<_application_registration_in_the_azure_app_portal>> and
<<_how_to_obtain_the_plan_id_for_wifi_mac_automation_tasks>> chapters how to obtain these values.

==== MSTeams_Notifications Section
The MSTeams_Notifications section contains these settings:

    [MSTeams_Notifications]
    msteams_webhook = <webhook_link>
    msteams_adaptive_card_info = (...)
    msteams_adaptive_card_warning = (...)
    msteams_adaptive_card_error = (...)

* the only value you have to set here:
** dedicate an MS Teams Chat Channel for Status and Error Messages of the
EFG Automation
** Go to `Connectors` and add an `Incoming Webhook` to this Channel
** copy the webhook link from this `Incoming Webhook` and add it to the `msteams_webhook` field in this config section

==== EFGAutomation Section
The EFGAutomation section contains these settings:

    [EFGAutomation]
    send_msteams_status_messages = yes
    send_msteams_error_messages = yes

|===
|Value|Meaning

|`send_msteams_status_messages`
|Set to `yes` if you want to receive status messages into the MS Teams Channel, otherwise set to `no`

|`send_msteams_error_messages`
|Currently sending error message cannot be turned off, thus keep this set to `yes`.

=== Running the

== Running the efg_automation suite

While the `efg_automation.py` orchestrates the entire suite, each component has
a CLI on its own and offers a CLI with limited capabilities which are mainly intended
for testing the components.

=== The `efg_o365.py` module

Usage from command line:

----
usage: efg_o365.py [-h] [--configfile CONFIGFILE] [--do_initial_auth]
                   [--debug] [--info]
                   {show_open_tasks}

EFG O365 Planner Task automation: manage Planner Tasks

positional arguments:
  {show_open_tasks}     the command to execute

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --configfile CONFIGFILE
                        our configfile (default is efg_automation.ini)
  --do_initial_auth     must be specified if the initial authentication
                        against O365 should be performed
  --debug               print debug output
  --info                print info output
----

:icons: font
NOTE: use the `show_open_tasks` command to test connectivity to O365


=== The `efg_wifi_automation.py` module
Usage from command line:

----
usage: efg_wifi_automation.py [-h] --wifi_name WIFI_NAME [--macfile MACFILE]
                              [--configfile CONFIGFILE] [--debug] [--info]
                              {show_macs,set_mac_filter}

EFG WiFi automation: manage Unifi Cloud Key mac address filter

positional arguments:
  {show_macs,set_mac_filter}
                        the command to execute

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --wifi_name WIFI_NAME
                        the Cloud Key WiFi name (SSID) to work on
  --macfile MACFILE     the name of the file with mac addresses (not required
                        for the 'show_macs' command)
  --configfile CONFIGFILE
                        our configfile (default is efg_automation.ini)
  --debug               print debug output
  --info                print info output
----

[NOTE]
====
* the `show_macs` command shows the MAC addresses set in the WiFi filter of the SSID in question
* thus use the `show_macs` command for CloudKey connectivity testing
* the `set_mac_filter` command sets (= completely overwrites) the MAC address filter of the SSID specified by the `--wifi_name` parameter from the file specified in the `--macfile` parameter
* each MAC address entry in the MAC file is associated with a WiFi name (SSID) - the `set_mac_filter` command will only process entries with a matching WiFi name (SSID) as set by the `--wifi_name` parameter
* for the MAC file layout refer to <<_initial_mac_filter_setup_via_a_mac_address_file>>)
====

==== Initial MAC Filter Setup via a MAC address file

The rules for setting up a MAC address file are:

* each MAC address has to be on a separate line in the file
* the only allowed delimiter between two hex values is a colon `:`
* then - separated with a semicolon - the Wifi name (SSID) must follow (the `set_mac_filter` command will only process entries with a matching WiFi name (SSID) as set by the `--wifi_name` parameter)
* line comments are allowed: they must start with a hash `#` in column 1 of a line
* inline comments following a MAC address are allowed as well:
** they must be separated from the MAC address by one or more blanks
** they must start with a hash `#`
* blank lines are allowed as well and will be ignored

An example MAC address file showing these conventions looks like this:

    # John Doe
    aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff;my-SSID
    11:22:33:44:55:66;my-other-SSID      # Jane Doe


==== MAC address file update when processing ADDMAC and DELMAC tasks

ADDMAC and DELMAC are acronyms for these `Manage_MACFilter` class methods of the
`efg_wifi_automation.py` module:

|===
|Acronym|Method|Meaning

|ADDMAC
|add_mac_to_mac_filter()
|adds a MAC to a WiFi name (SSID) MAC address filter

|DELMAC
|remove_mac_from_mac_filter()
|removes a MAC from a WiFi name (SSID) MAC address filter

|===

If you set the `update_mac_file_on_add_remove` config setting to `yes` then each ADDMAC / DELMAC activity will update
a shadow MAC address file specified by the `--macfile` parameter as well.

The intention of maintaining a shadow MAC file is: Should a CloudKey configuration
be lost for whatever reason (accidential deletion, CloudKey Hardware Failure) then you can
easily restore the MAC address filter from this shadow MAC file using `efg_wifi_automation.py` 's `set_mac_filter` command.

However creating backups from the entire CloudKey config is a more holistic approach to prevent
configuration data loss in such cases -> thus I recommend taking this solution instead.


=== The `efg_automation.py` module

As already said this module is the main CLI module for the entire EFG automation.

Recommended usage: Run from crontab in the desired frequence.

General usage from command line:

----
usage: efg_automation.py [-h] [--configfile CONFIGFILE] [--macfile MACFILE]
                         [--debug] [--info]
                         {process_wifi_mac_tasks}

the EFG Automation CLI

positional arguments:
  {process_wifi_mac_tasks}
                        process all open WiFi MAC filter list tasks

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --configfile CONFIGFILE
                        our configfile (default is efg_automation.ini)
  --macfile MACFILE     the name of the file where MAC addresses will be
                        maintained if update_mac_file_on_add_remove is set
                        active (default is mac_addresses.txt)
  --debug               print debug output
  --info                print info output
----

Invoking this program will

* read all open *ADDMAC* / *DELMAC* Planner Tasks to add or remove MAC addresses
* then add or remove the MAC in question to or from the CloudKey WiFi name (SSID) MAC filter with the WiFi name that is set in the *ADDMAC* / *DELMAC* planner task
* if the `update_mac_file_on_add_remove` setting in the config is set, then all ADDMAC / DELMAC changes will be mirrored to that MAC address file (so that the file has the same inventory of MACs than the Cloudkey MAC filters).

WARNING: Manual MAC filter changes applied directly to the CloudKey config via the CloudKey GUI will NOT be automatically detected and mirrored back to the MAC address file --> in that case the file and the MAC filter list in the CloudKey will start to diverge!
